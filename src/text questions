3- fun Create a Student class, demonstrating primary, and secondary constructor
also, init block with companion object   (Teacher Task)
4- Create a class for cylinder (radius , height)
        calculate  base area, and volume
        create a primary constructor with only "radius"
        create a secondary constructor with "radius" and "height"
        declare a static property indicates how many cylinders
         have been created
        also, when a cylinder object is created print
        "a cylinder with base radius = ___ cm,
        has been created"(Student Task)
